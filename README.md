# ADBTool2

This tool is a second version that sprouted off the ADBeasyInfo

Intended to make it easier to get Serial Number, IMEI, MAC ADDRESS, and ICCID
information off Android phones. 

There are various ways of getting this information off Android devices. 

Extract folder and run ADB Tool 2 .exe. it is important that the adb and fastboot
files are in the same folder as the .exe but funcationality has been added to 
point to a different adb folder.

funcationality to run custom cammands has also been added. Commands do not need 
to start with "adb" or "fastboot"

Hope This helps.
